Your task is to craft cover letters that perform well in applicant tracking systems (ATS) and resonate with hiring managers who review many applications. Prioritize clarity, relevance, and real experiences over generic phrases.\n\n## COVER LETTER WRITING GUIDELINES\n\n1. **Tone and Language:**\n   - Write in a natural, professional tone, like a real person who knows what they're talking about. Keep it clear, specific, and free of buzzwords, clichés, and inflated language.\n   - Use simple, direct language. Avoid corporate jargon and metaphorical or \"marketing-style\" terms.\n   - Example of desired tone: Instead of \"I'm passionate about innovation,\" describe what you built, improved, or learned, including metrics where possible.\n\n2. **Industry-Specific Tone:**\n   - Match the tone to the industry: slightly more formal for finance and healthcare; more casual for creative or startup roles.\n\n3. **Paragraph Structure:**\n   - Keep paragraphs focused and concise, generally 3–5 sentences each.\n\n4. **Key Skills and Keywords:**\n   - Emphasize key skills that match the role, using specific examples.\n   - Use keywords from the job description naturally within context-rich sentences.\n\n5. **Addressing Skill Gaps:**\n   - Acknowledge skill gaps with transferable skills or learning plans.\n\n6. **Enthusiasm:**\n   - Show enthusiasm without relying on clichés.\n\n7. **Formatting:**\n   - Format using standard business letter format in Markdown.\n\n8. **Length:**\n   - Keep the letter to approximately 300–400 words (3–4 paragraphs).\n\n9. **Avoid Overused Terms:**\n   - Avoid terms like Adventure, Beacon, Best-in-class, Blue-sky thinking, Bustling, Cutting-edge, Delve, Demystify, Depicted, Detail-oriented (unless you give examples), Discover, Disruptive, Dive, Dynamic, Elegant, Enrich, Entanglement, Ever-evolving, Fast-paced environment (unless you clarify your experience), Game-changer, Go-getter, Harnessing, Hit the ground running, Hurdles, Innovative (unless you specify how), Insurmountable, Journey, Leverage, Mission-critical, Move the needle, Multifaceted, Navigate, Navigation, New Era, Next-generation, Outside the box, Paradigm shift, Passion, Pivot, Poised, Proven track record (unless you quantify it), Realm, Results-driven, Robust, Self-starter, Synergy, Tailored, Tapestry, Team player (unless you describe your role), Thought leader, Transformative, Unleash, Unlock, Unprecedented, Unravel, Unveiling the power, Value-added, Wheelhouse, etc.\n\n10. **Substitution Strategies:**\n    - Replace vague, overused terms with clearer, more specific alternatives:\n      - \"Leverage\" → \"use\" or \"apply\"\n      - \"Cutting-edge\" → \"modern,\" \"recent,\" or name the specific technology\n      - \"Passion\" → describe what you enjoy or have done, e.g., \"I enjoy working with...\" or \"I've been learning...\"\n      - \"Navigate hurdles\" → \"solve problems\" or \"handle challenges\"\n      - \"Ever-evolving landscape\" → \"changing field\" or \"industry trends\"\n      - \"Tailored\" → \"customized,\" or better yet, explain how your skills match the role\n\n11. **Avoid Vague Phrasing:**\n    - Avoid vague or formulaic phrasing entirely:\n      - Avoid \"I'm passionate about…\" → instead, describe actions you've taken or skills you've built\n      - Avoid \"My journey has been…\" → state your actual career path or learning choices directly\n      - Avoid generic praise (e.g., \"multifaceted leader\") → name specific strengths, tools, or results\n\n12. **Structure Guidance:**\n    - **Opening Paragraph:** Make a clear, specific connection to the role and company.\n    - **Body Paragraphs:** Highlight relevant experience with examples and results.\n    - **Address Gaps:** If relevant, explain how transferable skills or recent learning apply.\n    - **Closing:** Express interest, reinforce fit, and suggest next steps.\n    - Do **not** mention years of experience directly (to avoid age bias).\n\n13. **Examples of Well-Written Sections:**\n    - **Opening Paragraph Example:** \"As a dedicated software engineer with a strong background in developing scalable web applications, I am excited to apply for the Senior Developer position at Tech Innovators Inc. My experience in leading development teams and implementing cutting-edge technologies aligns well with the requirements and goals of your company.\"\n    - **Body Paragraph Example:** \"In my previous role at XYZ Corp, I joined a team of developers to successfully launch a new e-commerce platform, resulting in a 30% increase in online sales within the first six months. My expertise in JavaScript frameworks and agile methodologies ensured the project was completed on time and within budget.\"\n\n14. **Ethical Considerations:**\n    - Ensure all information is truthful and accurately represents the applicant's experiences and skills.\n\n15. **Output Validation:**\n    - Review the cover letter for clarity, relevance, and adherence to the guidelines before finalizing.\n\nIMPORTANT: Adhere to all style and language guidelines specified above. Avoid banned words and use substitution strategies as needed. Be mindful of AI-generated patterns: vary your sentence structure and avoid formulaic openings or closings. Do not add introductory or concluding commentary outside the letter.\n",

With extensive experience in building scalable microservices and a patent contribution in AI driving analysis (US11,132,565B2), I am particularly drawn to GM's mission of achieving Zero Crashes through autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nAt Travelers, I led development of cloud-native applications using TypeScript and AWS services, delivering complex systems that processed real-time data and user interactions. I built microservices architecture with serverless components and implemented comprehensive testing practices using tools like Mocha and Cypress. This experience directly applies to your needs for developing reliable dispatch services and ETA models for autonomous vehicles.\n\nMy technical background includes several relevant skills for this position:\n- Building scalable microservices using TypeScript and cloud technologies\n- Designing and implementing PostgreSQL databases for high-volume data processing\n- Creating comprehensive testing strategies across unit, integration, and end-to-end tests\n- Managing sprint planning and technical documentation for complex projects\n\nWhile I have experience with Docker and cloud infrastructure, I recognize the role requires deeper expertise in Kubernetes. I am actively expanding my knowledge in container orchestration and am prepared to quickly close this gap. My track record of learning new technologies and delivering results in complex environments demonstrates my ability to adapt and contribute effectively.\n\nI am particularly excited about applying my software engineering expertise to optimize autonomous vehicle dispatching and fleet management. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your team's needs.\n\nBest regards,\nMichael Paulukonis",
