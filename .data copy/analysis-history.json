Your team's mission to build developer-first tooling deeply resonates with my background, particularly my experience creating a Firefox extension, `SkipScreen`, that automated web workflows for over 500,000 daily users. I am motivated by the opportunity to apply this same focus on developer efficiency to a product as critical as LaunchDarkly.\n\nAt Travelers, I was part of a five-person team that built and launched a new insurance technology product in under six months. I designed and developed the microservices architecture using Node.js, TypeScript, and AWS serverless components. This role required close collaboration with product managers and business owners to translate initial concepts into a market-ready application, an experience that directly aligns with your need for an engineer who can work effectively in a fast-paced, iterative environment.\n\nMy experience also includes improving existing developer workflows. At Insurity, I re-engineered a core development tool, introducing unit testing with NUnit and QUnit to improve stability and maintainability. I established testing best practices using Mocha, Chai, and Cypress on other projects, demonstrating my commitment to the high code quality and automated testing your team values. While my primary front-end experience is with Vue.js, its component-based architecture is very similar to React, and I am confident I can quickly become proficient. I am also a quick study with new languages and would look forward to adding Go to my skillset.\n\nI am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to tools that are embedded in the software development lifecycle. I am eager to discuss how my background in building full-stack solutions and my interest in using AI tooling to improve engineering efficiency can benefit the Feature Management team.\n\nSincerely,\nMichael Paulukonis",

Your mission to empower developers with best-in-class controls is something I have practiced throughout my career, from building a Firefox extension with over 3.5 million downloads that automated user workflows to developing new, developer-focused products at Travelers.\n\nIn my role as a Senior Engineer on an innovation team at Travelers, I was responsible for taking a new insurance tech product from concept to market in under six months. I designed and built the full-stack solution using Node.js, TypeScript, and AWS serverless components, creating a microservices architecture that served as a new pattern for the organization. I also established the project’s testing standards with Mocha, Chai, and Cypress, ensuring we balanced development speed with production-ready code. This experience directly reflects the responsibilities of building developer-first tooling and collaborating cross-functionally to define requirements in an iterative environment.\n\nThe job description mentions a preference for React and experience with AI tooling. While my most recent work has centered on Vue.js, I am familiar with React from past projects and am confident in my ability to adapt quickly, given my deep background in component-based JavaScript frameworks. I also actively use AI tools like MS Copilot to improve my daily engineering efficiency and am currently completing coursework on Generative AI to further build on this skill.\n\nI am impressed by LaunchDarkly’s position as a leader in feature management and its clear focus on the developer experience.

Building developer-first tooling is my jam, and from our conversation, the work your team is doing sounds like a perfect fit.\n\nThat insurance tech project I mentioned at Travelers? We took it from a concept to a full-blown product in under 8 months. I was all over the full stack—Node.js, TypeScript, and Vue.js, all running on AWS serverless components. I also set up our testing pipeline with Mocha, Chai, and Cypress because shipping clean, maintainable code is non-negotiable, and it sounds like your team holds that same high bar.\n\nMy whole thing is streamlining workflows for users, like with my old Firefox extension, SkipScreen, which blew up to over 500,000 daily users. I know you all use React, and while my recent work is in Vue, they're two sides of the same coin. I'll get up to speed faster than Loki can cause some mischief. I'm also already using AI tools in my daily workflow to code smarter, not just harder.\n\nAnyway, I’m stoked about the chance to contribute to a product that other developers actually use and rely on. Let me know what the next steps are.\n\nTalk soon,\n\nMichael Paulukonis",

Your mission to empower developers with best-in-class controls aligns perfectly with my experience building developer-focused tools and my commitment to creating maintainable, high-quality software systems.\n\nAt Travelers, I led the development of several mission-critical developer tools and microservices using TypeScript, Node.js, and AWS technologies. I designed and implemented a flexible notification system that became a new team pattern for template-based communications, demonstrating my ability to create solutions that improve developer workflows. Working in a \"you-build-it-you-run-it\" environment, I established testing best practices that balanced development speed with code quality, using tools like Mocha, Chai, and Cypress.\n\nWhile my primary frontend experience is with Vue.js rather than React, I have consistently shown the ability to adapt to new frameworks quickly. My experience with TypeScript and Node.js provides a strong foundation for working with LaunchDarkly's tech stack. I've recently enhanced my technical toolkit by completing coursework in Generative AI for Software Development, showing my commitment to staying current with emerging technologies that improve engineering efficiency.\n\nI'm particularly drawn to LaunchDarkly's emphasis on developer experience and the opportunity to directly influence the developer roadmap. My background in transforming complex codebases into stable systems, combined with my experience collaborating across product and design teams, positions me well to contribute to your feature management platform. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills align with your team's needs.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMichael Paulukonis",

The opportunity to contribute to the core infrastructure that powers developer workflows at scale is particularly appealing, especially given Vercel's commitment to enabling developers to ship the best products. Your mission resonates deeply with my passion for improving the developer experience and my desire to have a tangible impact on how software is built and deployed on the web.\n\nMy background aligns well with many of the key requirements for this role. I have extensive experience building microservices, designing and maintaining APIs, and working with JavaScript/TypeScript in full-stack applications. My experience with AWS, including services like Lambda, API Gateway, and SQS, demonstrates my ability to build and deploy scalable systems. I'm also familiar with modern frontend frameworks like VueJS and React, which enables me to contribute to improving user interfaces. Furthermore, I've consistently focused on testing and documentation to ensure code quality and maintainability throughout my career. My previous experience with CI/CD tools has allowed me to become familiar with what developers need from such platforms.\n\nWhile I don't have direct experience building a CI/CD platform, I have a strong understanding of CI/CD principles and workflows, and I'm eager to apply my skills to this specific domain. I recognize the importance of webhooks in the CI/CD process, and I'm confident in my ability to quickly learn and implement them effectively. Although I haven't specifically enhanced the reliability of CI/CD *platforms*, I have focused on enhancing the reliability of various types of systems and have experience with on-call rotations and problem solving in high-pressure situations. I am comfortable with adapting my skills to new technologies and domains and am confident I can become a valuable asset to your team.\n\nI am enthusiastic about the possibility of joining Vercel and contributing to your mission of empowering developers. I am eager to learn more about the specific challenges and opportunities within your CI/CD team and how my skills and experience can contribute to your continued success. Thank you for considering my application.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael Paulukonis\n",
