Okay, I will create a new overview file for the cover letter feature at `/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/job-posting-analyzer/notes/cover-letters/README.md`.

This file will include:
- A general overview of the cover letter generation feature.
- Core functionalities like tailoring cover letters to job descriptions and AI integration.
- An outline of the client-side and server-side components involved.
- A description of the data flow.
- Notes on AI service integration for generation.
- Potential future enhancements.
 I've created a `README.md` file for the cover letter feature in the `` directory. This file provides an overview of the feature, its core functionality, component architecture, data flow, AI integration, and potential future enhancements, similar to the other documentation files you mentioned.
