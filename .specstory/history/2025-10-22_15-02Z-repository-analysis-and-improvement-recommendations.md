I'll conduct a comprehensive analysis of your Job Posting Analyzer repository. Let me start by examining the key files and structure to understand the project thoroughly. Now I'll create the comprehensive repository snapshot based on my analysis: I've created a comprehensive repository snapshot that provides a detailed analysis of your Job Posting Analyzer project. Here's what the analysis covers:

## 📊 **Key Findings Summary:**

**Strengths:**
- Well-architected Nuxt.js 3 application with clean separation of concerns
- Excellent AI service abstraction with pluggable architecture
- Good TypeScript usage and modern development practices
- Comprehensive Docker setup and E2E testing foundation

**Critical Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Security**: Input validation, rate limiting, error handling standardization
2. **Testing**: Increase coverage from ~55% to 80%+
3. **Documentation**: API docs, user guides, architecture decisions
4. **Type Safety**: Eliminate remaining `any` types, add runtime validation

**Project Status**: **Active Development MVP** - Feature-complete with strong foundations but needs production hardening.

## 🎯 **Immediate Priorities:**

1. **Week 1-2**: Security hardening (input validation, rate limiting, CSP headers)
2. **Week 2-4**: Documentation completion (API docs, user guides, contributing guidelines)
3. **Week 3-5**: Code quality improvements (test coverage, TypeScript cleanup)
4. **Week 4-8**: Feature completion (OpenAI integration, authentication planning)

## 📋 **Missing Documentation Identified:**

The analysis suggests creating these key documentation files:
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development workflow
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policy
- `/docs/requirements/PRD.md` - Product requirements
- `README.md` - API documentation
- `/docs/decisions/` - Architecture decision records

## 🔍 **Technical Assessment:**

- **Code Complexity**: Good (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- **Test Coverage**: Needs improvement (⭐⭐⭐) 
- **Documentation**: Adequate (⭐⭐⭐)
- **Maintainability**: Good (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- **Technical Debt**: Moderate (⭐⭐⭐)

The snapshot document serves as a comprehensive onboarding guide for new team members, a technical overview for stakeholders, and an improvement roadmap for the development team. It represents the current state as of October 22, 2025, and provides concrete next steps for moving toward production readiness.

taskmaster, add_tasks for the following:

Critical Areas for Improvement:

1. Security: Input validation, rate limiting, error handling standardization
2. Testing: Increase coverage from ~55% to 80%+
3. Documentation: API docs, user guides, architecture decisions
4. Type Safety: Eliminate remaining any types, add runtime validation

I'll help you add tasks for the critical improvement areas using Taskmaster. Let me first check if Taskmaster is initialized in this project, then add the specific tasks you've outlined. Let me check if tasks.json exists in the .taskmaster directory: It looks like Taskmaster is initialized but no tasks exist yet. Let me check the current project status and then create the tasks for the critical improvement areas: Perfect! No tasks exist yet, so I'll create the comprehensive tasks for the critical improvement areas you've identified. Let me add these one by one: Now let me view the tasks to confirm they were created successfully: Excellent! All 10 improvement tasks have been successfully created in Taskmaster. Now let me expand these tasks into detailed subtasks to make them more actionable for implementation: Perfect! Now let me generate the individual task files and show you what we've accomplished: Let me show you the next task to work on: Perfect! I've successfully completed your request. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

add task for a new feature/workflow - separate from resume-to-cover-letter, although resume will be part of this. There will be a - special workflow for creating Upwork proposals. A job description (for a contract) will be entered. The prompt #file:upwork_proposal_analysis.txt was derived from https://prompts4all.net/blog/prompts-for-work/14-ai-prompts-to-write-winning-upwork-proposals . This task is high priority.
