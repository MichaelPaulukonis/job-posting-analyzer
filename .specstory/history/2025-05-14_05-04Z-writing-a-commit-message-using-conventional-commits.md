# Writing a commit message using Conventional Commits (2025-05-14 05:04Z)

_**User**_

Please write a commit message for the most recent changes following the Conventional Commits specification.

_**Assistant**_

I don't have information about the specific changes you've recently made to the job-posting-analyzer project. To write an accurate commit message following the Conventional Commits specification, I'd need details about what was changed.

Based on the project context, a proper commit message would follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional longer description of the changes]

[optional footer]
```

For example:
- `feat(resume): add PDF parsing functionality`
- `fix(analysis): resolve job skills comparison algorithm`
- `docs: update README with setup instructions`

Could you provide information about what changes were made so I can craft an appropriate commit message?
