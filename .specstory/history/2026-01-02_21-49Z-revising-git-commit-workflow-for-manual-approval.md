# Revising Git Commit Workflow for Manual Approval (2026-01-02 21:49Z)

_**User (2026-01-02 21:52Z)**_

I need to revise the "Git Commit Workflow"  section in #file:copilot-instructions.md . The line "6. **Commit Changes:** After the user approves the message, stage the `CHANGELOG.md` file (if modified) and run `git commit`." is not followed by some LLMs (gemini-cli at least). They make commits when they feel confident, even if I have not manually tested or approved the commit. Manual user approval is mandatory.

The user wants to revise the "Git Commit Workflow" section in the copilot-instructions.md file. They're concerned that step 6 is not being followed by some LLMs (particularly gemini-cli), which are making commits without waiting for manual user approval.

Let me look at the current section in the file. The user has the file open and has selected line 224. Let me read the relevant section.

From the attachment, I can see the current text is:

```markdown
### **Mandatory Git Commit Workflow**

When you are asked to create a commit, you **MUST** follow these steps in order:

1. **Analyze Changes:** Run `git status` and `git diff --staged` to understand the modifications.
2. **Evaluate for Changelog:** Review the changes against the criteria in `.github/changelog-management.md`.
3. **Ask About Changelog:** If the changes meet the criteria (e.g., new features, UI changes, bug fixes), you **MUST** ask the user: "Should I create a changelog entry for these changes?" You may also provide advice on whether an entry seems warranted (e.g., "This is a minor fix, so you may choose to skip it to avoid cluttering the changelog.").
4. **Create Changelog (if approved):** If the user agrees, update `CHANGELOG.md` according to the project's format guidelines.
5. **Propose Commit Message:** After handling the changelog, draft a commit message that follows the Conventional Commits specification.
6. **Commit Changes:** After the user approves the message, stage the `CHANGELOG.md` file (if modified) and run `git commit`.
```

The user wants to make it more explicit that manual user approval is mandatory before any commit is made. I should strengthen the language in step 6 to make this crystal clear.

Wait, the user is looking at /Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/v0-driftboard/.github/copilot-instructions.md, but I was given the attachment from that file. 

However, their workspace is /Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/job-posting-analyzer. They mentioned they want to revise the section, so they probably want me to update the file in their CURRENT workspace (job-posting-analyzer), not the v0-driftboard project.

Let me check the workspace info - yes, the workspace is job-posting-analyzer. And from the instructions attachment, I can see there's a file at /Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/job-posting-analyzer/.github/copilot-instructions.md (it's listed in the attachments section of the instructions).

So I need to read the current file in the job-posting-analyzer workspace to see what's there, then make the necessary revisions to strengthen the language around mandatory user approval before commits.I'll help you revise the Git Commit Workflow section to make manual user approval more explicit and emphatic. Let me first read the current content in your job-posting-analyzer project. Now I'll update the Git Commit Workflow section to make manual user approval absolutely explicit and mandatory. I'll strengthen steps 5 and 6 to prevent any LLM from making commits without explicit user approval. I've revised the Git Commit Workflow section in `undefined` with much stronger language to prevent LLMs from making autonomous commits:

**Key changes:**
1. **Step 5** now explicitly says "**STOP HERE and wait for explicit user approval**"
2. **New Step 6** is entirely dedicated to waiting for manual approval, with emphasis that the user may need to test or review
3. **Step 7** (formerly step 6) now includes multiple warnings: "**ONLY AFTER**", "explicit approval", and "**NEVER commit autonomously**"

The language is now much more emphatic with:
- Multiple uses of **MUST**, **DO NOT**, **NEVER** in bold
- Clear separation of "propose message" from "commit"
- Explicit acknowledgment that users need time to test/review
- Stronger prohibition against autonomous commits

This should make it much clearer to all LLMs (including gemini-cli) that they must wait for your explicit go-ahead before executing any git commit commands.
