# Despite a recent implementation, the storage for c (2025-07-03 13:03Z)

_**User**_

Despite a recent implementation, the storage for conversation.ts claims to not save anything. This is an incorrect assertion, since we do have persistent file-based storage, and I can see the conversation components added to that history.

        // For now, just return success since we don't have persistent storage
        // In a real app, this would save to a database
        console.log(`Conversation ${conversation.id} would be saved for analysis ${conversation.analysisId}`);

  However, that history does NOT appear to be used in cover-letter generation. The docs suggest the sequence "remove flowery language", and flower is gone. Then "make it more technical" and it is more technical and the flowery stays gone! Except it is not working that way - the flowery comes back.

  In short, we are persisting the conversation to storage - the console.log is incorrect. But the letter generation does not appear to be using the full history.

I see the issue! The conversation storage API currently doesn't actually use the persistent storage service, despite the fact that other parts of the system do have persistent storage implemented. Let me examine the storage service and fix this.
