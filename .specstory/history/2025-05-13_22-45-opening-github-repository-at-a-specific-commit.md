# Opening GitHub repository at a specific commit (2025-05-13 18:45:08)

How can I open my github repository at a specific commit?

---

_**Assistant**_

To open a GitHub repository at a specific commit, you have a few options:

1. **Using the commit hash in the URL**:
   ```
   https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/tree/{commit-hash}
   ```

2. **To view a specific file at that commit**:
   ```
   https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit-hash}/{path-to-file}
   ```

3. **To view the commit details/changes**:
   ```
   https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/commit/{commit-hash}
   ```

For example, if your commit hash is `a1b2c3d4`, you would use:
```
https://github.com/username/repository/tree/a1b2c3d4
```

You can find the commit hash in your repository's commit history or by using Git commands like `git log`.
