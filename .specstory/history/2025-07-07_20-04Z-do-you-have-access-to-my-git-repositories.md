Do you have access to my git repositories?

Yes, I can work with your Git repositories. I have access to a set of tools that allow me to interact with repositories on GitHub. For example, I can:

*   Read files from your repositories.
*   List issues and pull requests.
*   Create branches and pull requests.
*   Review code changes.

I can also see your local file changes that have not been committed yet. My access is provided through the tools I use and respects your permissions and authentication for private repositories.
