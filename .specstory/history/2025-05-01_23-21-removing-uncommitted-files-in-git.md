# Removing uncommitted files in Git (2025-05-01 19:21:25)

_**User**_

In git, How do I remove files that I just added, but have not committed?

---

_**Assistant**_

```bash
git rm --cached <file1> <file2> ...
```

This command removes the specified files from the staging area (index) without deleting them from your working directory. If you want to remove the files from both the staging area and your working directory, use:

```bash
git rm <file1> <file2> ...

When we are working in "Copilot Edits", how long of a time can context persist? If we are working on the same project, but jumping around to different features, should I close the session and start a new one for performance reasons? Does keeping the same session open longer improve context, or does it make no difference?

What are some practices for sessions in copilot edits?

---

_**Assistant**_

I don't have specific details on the exact context window duration or session management of "Copilot Edits." However, here's a breakdown of general best practices based on how these tools typically function:

*   **Context Window:** Large language models have a limited context window. The longer the session and the more code you interact with, the higher the chance that earlier parts of the conversation or code become less relevant or are "forgotten."
*   **Feature Focus:** If you're switching between significantly different features, it can be helpful to start a new session. This ensures the AI focuses on the code relevant to the current task.
*   **Session Length:** There's no hard rule for session length. If you notice the suggestions becoming less relevant or the AI seems to be missing context, restarting the session can help.
*   **Experimentation:** The best approach is to experiment and see what works best for your workflow. Pay attention to the quality of the suggestions and the AI's understanding of your code as the session progresses. If you notice a decline, a new session is likely beneficial.
*   **Clarity in Prompts:** Regardless of session length, always provide clear and specific prompts to guide the AI.

In summary, while longer sessions *could* theoretically improve context, the limited context window and potential for irrelevant information to accumulate often make shorter, focused sessions more effective, especially when switching between features.
