# I'm looking into replacing the fie-storage mechani (2025-07-02 03:36Z)

_**User**_

I'm looking into replacing the fie-storage mechanism ("provide") with a database. I'd like some reccomendations on what might be god db solutions - I'd like something relatively simple, I was thinking Sqllite. However, the nature of the data might make more sense in a NoSQL/document database, instead. Please provide me with several option, with the pros and concs of each. Deployment is not a major concern, the target environment will be my local Docker host. Please write out your reccomendations into a markddown-dormatted filde in `notes/`

I'll analyze your current file storage mechanism and create a comprehensive database recommendation document for you. Let me first examine your current data structure and then provide detailed recommendations. Now let me create a comprehensive database recommendations document based on your current data structure and requirements.
