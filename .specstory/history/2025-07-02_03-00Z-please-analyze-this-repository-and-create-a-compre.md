I'll analyze this repository comprehensively and create a detailed snapshot. Let me start by examining the key files and structure to understand the project better. Now let me examine the Docker configuration and testing setup to complete my understanding: Now I'll create a comprehensive repository analysis based on all the information I've gathered. I'll create the main analysis document and several supporting files. Now I'll create additional documentation files to support the main analysis:

## 🎯 Key Findings Summary:

**Strengths:**
- Well-architected Nuxt.js 3 application with clean separation of concerns
- Excellent AI service abstraction with pluggable architecture
- Good TypeScript usage and modern development practices
- Comprehensive Docker setup and E2E testing

**Critical Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Security**: Input validation, rate limiting, error handling
2. **Testing**: Increase coverage from 55% to 80%+
3. **Documentation**: API docs, user guides, architecture decisions
4. **Type Safety**: Eliminate `any` types, add runtime validation

**Project Status**: **Active Development** - Feature-complete MVP with strong foundations but needs production hardening.

The analysis shows this is a well-designed project with good architectural decisions. The main focus should be on security hardening, testing improvements, and documentation completion before moving to advanced features.
