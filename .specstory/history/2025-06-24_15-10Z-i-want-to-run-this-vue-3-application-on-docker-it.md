# I want to run this Vue 3 application on Docker. It (2025-06-24 15:10Z)

_**User**_

I want to run this Vue 3 application on Docker. It will not be exposed to the public and the image will not be shared anywhere. In other words, I want the .env file part of the deployment. Please create a plan to build and dockerize the app. If there are updates that need to be made to configs, be sure to point them out. If there are multiple options, list them with pros and cons. The main goal of putting this app onto Docker is to make it available for my use more readily. A secondary goal is both docker experience and an excuse for me to expand the project features. Save the plan in markdown format to `notes/plans/`. Do not take any other actions until I give the go-ahead.
