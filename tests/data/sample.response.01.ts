- Job Posting: "DataDog" --> Resume: "Cloudwatch" (both are monitoring/observability tools, but different specific products)

- DevOps practices
- Technical documentation (specifically API specifications, usage guidelines, and architectural diagrams)

4. Specific suggestions to improve the resume for this job posting.
- Under "Technical Skills", move API development from "Familiar" to "Primary".
- Add a section under "Technical Skills" for "API Design and Security" listing relevant concepts.
- Add GitHub Actions to the list of CI/CD tools under "Familiar" or include it in the description of past experience (if possible).
- Explicitly mention "API specifications, usage guidelines, and architectural diagrams" under documentation or a separate "Documentation" section.
- If possible, quantify the impact of your work in previous roles with metrics (e.g., "Reduced API latency by X%" or "Improved API availability to Y%").
- Highlight experience with DevOps practices more prominently, beyond just mentioning CI/CD, such as infrastructure as code (Terraform), configuration management, and monitoring.
- In the Summary Section, emphasize experience building *secure* and *high-performance* APIs.`
