export const response = `Here's an analysis of the job posting and resume, highlighting matches, gaps, and providing suggestions for improvement.

**1. Skills and Qualifications That Match:**

*   **Experience:** 8+ years of software engineering experience demonstrated (Travelers 2017-Present, Insurity 2014-2017, Westbrook 2011-2014).
*   **Engineering Management/Team Leadership:** Insurity role specifically mentions "Team-lead and development owner." Travelers mentions leading a 5-person team and demonstrating technical leadership.
*   **Modernizing Legacy Systems:** Insurity role details re-engineering codebase to modernize architecture and stabilize application, and cleaning/migrating data.
*   **SOA:** Travelers role mentions Microservices Architecture with AWS (EventBridge, Lambda, API Gateway, RDS, SNS, SQS, S3, etc.).
*   **AWS Infrastructure:** Strong mention of AWS in the resume (Lambda, EC2, API Gateway, S3, EventBridge, RDS, SNS, SQS, etc.)
*   **Modern Programming Languages and Frameworks:** Fluency in JavaScript, Node.js, C#, .NET, Vue.js, etc.
*   **API-First System Design:** Mention of API development in "Familiar" skills and building microservices and APIs in summary. Travelers role mentions the creation of a serverless architecture, which often relies heavily on well-designed APIs.
*   **Open Source and Commercial RDBMS and NoSQL stacks:** Skills list includes SQL, DynamoDB, MongoDB.
*   **Docker/Containers:** Skills list includes Docker.
*   **CI/CD Pipelines:** Skills list includes CI/CD.
*   **Managing Engineers/Delivery Timelines/Accountability:** Insurity role mentions leading development estimation and work prioritization across developers and business owners.
*   **Strong Communication & Interpersonal Skills:** Insurity role mentions effectively delivered tool enhancements and efficiencies by leading development estimation and work prioritization across developers and business owners.

**2. Skills and Qualifications Mentioned in the Job Posting but Missing from the Resume:**

*   **Strangler Fig Pattern/Incremental Modernization:** While the resume describes modernizing code, it doesn't explicitly use the phrase "strangler fig pattern" or emphasize incremental modernization as a specific strategy.
*   **SRE Practices (Infrastructure as Code: CloudFormation/Terraform, Observability/Monitoring platforms such as ELK, NewRelic, DataDog, Grafana):** Terraform is listed in the "Familiar" skills, but CloudFormation, ELK, NewRelic, DataDog, and Grafana are not explicitly mentioned. Though Splunk is in the familiar list.
*   **Kubernetes (Container Orchestration):** Missing from technical skills.
*   **Security Best Practices: OWASP Top 10, NIST Controls:** Not explicitly mentioned.
*   **Focus on Quality: TDD, BDD, Integration Testing, Load/Performance Testing:** Resume mentions Unit Testing and Testing & QA but doesn't explicitly mention TDD, BDD, Integration Testing, Load/Performance Testing.
*    **Modern Cloud Native Architecture and Practices: High Availability and Scalability, 12 Factor App** Resume discusses AWS usage which aligns with these, but does not explicitly state high availability, scalability, and 12 factor app.
*   **DevOps Standards:** Although CI/CD is mentioned and DevOps practices were used in the Insurity role, the resume doesn't explicitly state that the applicant *enforces* DevOps standards.
*    **Documentation:** Listed as a primary skill, but is missing in the description of each work experience.

**3. Specific Suggestions to Improve the Resume for This Job Posting:**

*   **Quantify Achievements:** Use numbers to illustrate the impact of your work. Instead of "Re-engineered the codebase," try "Re-engineered a codebase resulting in a 30% performance increase and 20% reduction in bug reports."
*   **Explicitly mention the Strangler Fig pattern:** If you have experience with incremental modernization, explicitly state that you have used a "strangler fig pattern" to modernize legacy systems. For instance, "Led a team in migrating a monolithic application to a microservices architecture using the strangler fig pattern, resulting in..."
*   **Emphasize DevOps Experience:** Add details about your involvement in DevOps practices. For example, "Collaborated with DevOps to implement CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker, resulting in a 50% reduction in deployment time." In the Insurity Role add details about your experience working with DevOps to facilitate product builds and distribution practices across internal and external data centers.
*   **Highlight SRE Skills:** Since the job posting emphasizes SRE practices, add the phrase SRE to the resume. If you have used Terraform, highlight it more prominently (move it to the primary skills list). If you have experience with monitoring tools like ELK, New Relic, DataDog, or Grafana (even if limited), add them to the "Familiar" skills list. Also, add experiences from the travelers role where these technologies were used.
*   **Add Kubernetes:** If you have even basic experience with Kubernetes, add it to your skills list.
*   **Address Security Best Practices:** Add a bullet point highlighting your understanding or implementation of security best practices such as OWASP Top 10 or NIST Controls. For example, "Ensured application security by implementing OWASP Top 10 guidelines, resulting in a 15% reduction in security vulnerabilities."
*   **Expand on Testing Experience:** While you mention unit testing, expand on your testing experience by explicitly mentioning TDD, BDD, Integration Testing, and Load/Performance Testing if you have experience with them. Provide examples of how you implemented these practices and the resulting improvements in code quality. The Travelers bullet mentions using mocha, chai, sinon and cypress.
*   **Highlight Cloud Native and 12-Factor App:** State experience in the cloud native architecture and 12 factor app for the applications built at Travelers.
*   **Quantify Team Leadership:** Instead of just saying "Team-lead", say "Led a team of X engineers in..." and highlight the results of your leadership.
*   **Documentation:** Although documentation is listed as a primary skill, each work experience is missing that skill. When rewriting the bullets for work experience, add the creation of documentation to the role.
*   **Tailor Summary Statement:** Update the opening summary to directly address the needs of the job posting. For example: "Lead Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience modernizing legacy systems into scalable, service-oriented architectures on AWS. Proven ability to lead engineering teams, implement DevOps practices, and deliver high-quality solutions on time and within scope. Expertise in Node.js, Vue.js, AWS, and a passion for driving technical innovation."

By incorporating these suggestions, you can significantly improve your resume's match rate for this job posting and increase your chances of getting an interview.
