# job posting analyzer
This is a job posting analyzer that uses Google's Gemini to analyze job postings and provide insights on the skills and qualifications required for the job. It is built using Nuxt 3, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

Google Copilot did a bunch of heavy lifting on the setup.

## installation
To use the Google Gemini API, you'll need to install the Google Generative AI package.

`npm install @google/generative-ai`

TODO: This is currently listed as a requirement, but it should be an option.
