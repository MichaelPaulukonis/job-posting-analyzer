# THINK AND PLAN THIS OUT

## or iterate on features I want need

- special workflow for creating Upwork proposals
 - https://prompts4all.net/blog/prompts-for-work/14-ai-prompts-to-write-winning-upwork-proposals
 - I have a consolidated prompt, but it can be in pieces in a UI
- modifying my resume to match a JD - store the changes the AI made, allow for manual editing, store the manual changes and learn from that

- same for the letters - we already store the changes IIRC, but we need to especially note the AI suggestions that were manually modified AND LEARN FROM that



workflow where we run against more than one AI model?

Select the model from the provider

review the code again

login and user sessions

put this into firestore or ... supabase? to try it out?
