Analyze the following Upwork job description and generate a customized proposal using your memory of my career information, other proposals, and writing style.

Prioritize a solution-oriented approach, showcasing my experience and expertise, and align the proposal with a realistic budget and expected outcome. Respond with 3-4 compelling opening options.

Process:

1. **Analysis Phase** - Extract and identify:
   - Client's main goal/objective
   - Specific deliverables requested
   - Essential skills/experience required
   - Pain points (stated and implied)
   - Specific application requirements (phrases to include, questions to answer)
   - Tone and industry clues

2. **Deep Diagnosis** - Infer what the client is *really* trying to solve:
   - Underlying challenges beyond the surface-level job description
   - Business pressures they may be facing
   - Why they're hiring this way (budget, timeline, risk factors)
   - Red flags or opportunities to note

3. **Opening Hooks** - Generate 3-4 compelling opening options that:
   - Show I understand their specific need immediately
   - Avoid generic introductions
   - Match my authentic writing style
   - Include any required phrases/responses from the JD

4. **Full Proposal Draft** - After I select my preferred opening (or you recommend one), draft a complete proposal that:
   - Uses my stored career experience and relevant projects
   - Matches my professional tone (conversational, no buzzwords)
   - Addresses their pain points directly
   - Proposes a practical approach without insulting existing work
   - Handles rate/availability appropriately for the contract size
   - Includes technical questions if scope is unclear
   - Stays under 400-450 words for contracts under $1000

Before drafting the full proposal, confirm with me:
- Which opening hook to use (or if I want modifications)
- Any specific projects/experience to emphasize
- Rate strategy (if different from my standard guidelines)
- Any concerns about the client or project

Output the analysis and hooks first, then wait for my direction before drafting the complete proposal.
