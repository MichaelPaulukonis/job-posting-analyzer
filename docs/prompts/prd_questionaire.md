I need help creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the new Upwork proposal generator feature (using the prompt `docs/plans/prompts/upwork_proposal_analysis.txt`).
Task 11 (and subtasks) are about this feature, but may not represent the best path forward. First look at task 11, then guide me through this process by asking me targeted questions one section at a time. Integrate task elaborations when relevant. Wait for my response before moving to the next section. The PRD will be saved as a plan-file in `docs/plans/'.

Start with these sections in order:

1. **Problem Statement & Vision**
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Who experiences this problem?
   - What's our vision for the solution?

2. **Target Users & Use Cases**
   - Who are our primary users?
   - What are their main goals?
   - What are the key user journeys?

3. **Core Features & Requirements**
   - What are the must-have features?
   - What are nice-to-have features?
   - Any technical constraints?

4. **Success Metrics & Goals**
   - How will we measure success?
   - What are our key performance indicators?
   - What's our timeline?

5. **Technical Considerations**
   - Any platform requirements?
   - Integration needs?
   - Scalability expectations?

Please ask 2-3 focused questions for each section, then help me synthesise the information into a well-structured PRD format. Make the questions specific and actionable.

Let's start with the Problem Statement & Vision section.
