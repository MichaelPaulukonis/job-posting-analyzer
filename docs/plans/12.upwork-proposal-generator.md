# Upwork Proposal Generator - Product Requirements Document

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** November 3, 2025  
**Target MVP Date:** November 4, 2025  

## Problem Statement & Vision

### Problem Statement
Michael currently spends significant time on repetitive manual steps when creating Upwork proposals: opening desktop LLM applications (Claude/Perplexity), locating prompt templates, manually integrating job descriptions, and copying outputs. This process, repeated daily, creates friction that limits proposal volume and reduces time available for actual project work. Additionally, valuable insights from successful proposals, client feedback, and pricing strategies are manually tracked in separate project notes, making it difficult to leverage accumulated knowledge for future proposals.

### Vision
Create a local web-based tool that streamlines the proposal generation workflow through direct integration with existing MCP memory server. The tool should eliminate manual copy-paste steps, provide an intuitive interface accessible via Docker, and automatically capture/leverage institutional knowledge (successful phrases, pricing strategies, client insights) to improve proposal quality over time. This personal productivity tool prioritizes speed and effectiveness for a single user's workflow, with potential for broader application integration as a secondary learning objective.

### Success Criteria
- Reduce proposal creation time from current manual process to under 10 minutes per proposal
- Eliminate manual copy-paste steps between applications
- Automatically capture and reuse successful proposal elements
- Maintain 24/7 availability through local Docker deployment

- No external dependencies or cloud storage required
- Fast response times (<30 seconds for full proposal generation)
- Session persistence during proposal iteration workflow

## Success Metrics & Goals

### Primary Success Metrics
- **Personal judgment**: Success will be evaluated subjectively based on daily usage and perceived value
- **Time savings**: Reduce proposal creation friction to encourage daily proposal generation
- **Usage adoption**: Tool becomes preferred method over manual LLM workflow

### Timeline
- **MVP Target**: Tomorrow (November 4, 2025)
- **Minimum Viable Workflow**: Job description input → Suitability analysis → Basic proposal generation with MCP memory integration

### Quality Benchmarks
- **Deferred to future**: Statistical analysis requires higher usage volume than anticipated
- **Qualitative feedback**: Personal assessment of proposal quality and appropriateness
- **Iterative improvement**: Adjust based on real-world usage patterns

## Technical Considerations

### Platform & Deployment
- **MVP Approach**: Standalone Express.js application for speed (integrate into Nuxt 3 post-MVP)
- **Local Development**: Docker container with simple web interface
- **Framework**: Minimal Express.js with basic HTML forms (fastest to implement)

### MCP Memory Integration
- **Connection**: Integrate with existing MCP memory server at `/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/mcp-memory-service/`
- **Query Strategy**: Use prompt phrase "use your memory of my career and writing style" to trigger lookups
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle MCP unavailability with basic proposal generation
- **Storage Backend**: SQLite with vector embeddings (existing sqlite_vec configuration)

### AI Service Integration
- **Primary LLM**: Claude (existing configuration and API key)
- **Output Format**: Plaintext only for MVP (fastest implementation, direct Upwork paste)
- **Fallback**: Graceful error handling if Claude unavailable

### MVP Scope Constraints
- **Deferred Features**: 
  - Markdown output generation
  - New experience/phrase storage in MCP
  - Integration with existing Nuxt 3 codebase
  - Advanced gap analysis
- **Core MVP**: Job description input → Claude analysis with MCP memory → Plaintext proposal output

### Architecture Decision
- Build standalone Express.js app that can be easily ported to Nuxt 3 API routes later
- Focus on working functionality over code elegance
- Docker deployment for consistent local environment

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP (November 4, 2025)
1. **Core Workflow**: Standalone Express.js application with basic HTML interface
2. **Essential Features**: Job description input, Claude integration, MCP memory lookup, plaintext proposal output
3. **Deployment**: Docker container for local development and usage

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Post-MVP)
1. **Nuxt Integration**: Port functionality to existing Nuxt 3 application as dedicated pages/API routes
2. **Advanced Features**: Gap analysis, markdown output, enhanced memory storage
3. **UI/UX**: Improved interface design and user experience refinements

### Phase 3: Optimization (Future)
1. **Knowledge Capture**: Automated learning from successful proposals
2. **Integration**: Connect with existing job-search notes workflow
3. **Analytics**: Track and analyze proposal effectiveness patterns

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
- **Time Constraint**: 24-hour delivery timeline requires aggressive scope management
- **MCP Integration**: Dependency on external memory service for core functionality
