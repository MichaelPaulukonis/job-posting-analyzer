# Test Strategy:
## Testing Strategy

### 1. Documentation Accuracy Validation
- Cross-reference all documented steps with actual application functionality
- Verify that screenshots match current UI design and elements
- Test all links, references, and cross-documentation navigation
- Review with development team to ensure technical accuracy
- Implement documentation linting for formatting consistency

### 2. User Experience Testing
- Conduct task-based usability testing with documentation as sole guidance
- Measure completion rates and time-to-completion for key tasks
- Collect qualitative feedback on clarity and helpfulness
- Identify areas where users struggle to find relevant information
- Test documentation across different devices and screen sizes

### 3. Video Tutorial Effectiveness Testing
- Measure video engagement metrics (completion rates, drop-off points)
- Conduct A/B testing of different tutorial approaches where applicable
- Verify that videos remain accurate after UI updates
- Test playback across different browsers and connection speeds

### 4. Accessibility Compliance
- Test documentation with screen readers and assistive technologies
- Verify color contrast ratios for text readability
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout documentation
- Validate that all images have appropriate alt text
- Confirm that video tutorials have accurate captions

### 5. Continuous Improvement Process
- Implement analytics to track most-viewed and least-viewed documentation
- Create user feedback collection system with documentation ratings
- Establish regular documentation audit process based on support tickets
- Test search functionality effectiveness with common user queries
