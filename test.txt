# CLAUDE.md Creation Notes

## What Was Done

Created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file for the job-posting-analyzer repository to provide guidance to future Claude Code instances.

## Analysis Process

1. Read key documentation files:
   - README.md - Project overview, setup, and Docker instructions
   - package.json - Available scripts and dependencies
   - .github/copilot-instructions.md - Project structure and coding standards
   - .github/changelog-management.md - Git commit workflow

2. Explored project structure:
   - Directory tree (excluding node_modules)
   - Vue components (24 .vue files)
   - Server API routes and repositories
   - Service layer architecture
   - Type definitions

3. Analyzed key architectural files:
   - services/LLMServiceInterface.ts - Service abstraction layer
   - services/StorageService.ts - Hybrid storage implementation
   - types/index.ts - Core data structures
   - nuxt.config.ts - Application configuration
   - jest.config.js & playwright.config.ts - Testing setup

## Key Architectural Insights Documented

1. **Multi-Provider LLM Pattern**
   - Factory pattern for switching between Gemini, Claude, and mock services
   - Shared interface (LLMServiceInterface) implemented by all providers
   - User selection persisted in localStorage

2. **Hybrid Storage Architecture**
   - Server-first approach with localStorage fallback
   - Repository pattern on server side
   - FileStorageService for JSON persistence
   - Handles SSR scenarios gracefully

3. **Data Flow**
   - Analysis flow: Input → Service selection → LLM processing → Storage
   - Cover letter flow: Analysis → Sample selection → Streaming generation → Conversation tracking

4. **Component Organization**
   - Atomic design with subdirectories (input/, analysis/, admin/, common/, layout/)

5. **Git Workflow**
   - Mandatory changelog check before commits
   - Conventional Commits format
   - Semantic versioning rules

## What Was NOT Included (Intentionally)

- Exhaustive file/directory listings (easily discovered with tools)
- Generic development practices (obvious instructions)
- Repetitive information already clear from code
- Made-up sections like "Common Development Tasks" not in source docs

## Document Structure

1. Overview
2. Development Commands (install, dev, test, build, docker)
3. Environment Configuration
4. Architecture (LLM services, storage, data flow, components, server API, types)
5. Git Workflow (commit process, message format, versioning)
6. Important Patterns & Conventions (services, storage, components, API routes, TypeScript)
7. Docker Development
8. Pre-commit Hooks
9. File Parsing Support
