# End-to-End (E2E) Testing Strategy for Job Posting Analyzer

## 1. Testing Strategy Overview

- **Scope & Objectives:**
  - Validate complete user journeys and system workflows from the browser perspective.
  - Ensure critical business flows (resume analysis, cover letter generation, history, provider switching) work as intended.
  - Detect regressions and edge-case failures before production.
- **Test Pyramid Integration:**
  - Maintain a balance: unit tests (Jest/Vitest) for logic, integration tests for API/services, E2E (Playwright) for user flows.
- **Environment Setup:**
  - Use Playwright for E2E tests (headless and headed modes).
  - Isolate E2E test data (test user accounts, mock services, reset state between runs).
  - Run against local dev, staging, and optionally production (read-only) environments.
- **Browser/Device Coverage:**
  - Test on Chromium, WebKit, Firefox (Playwright default matrix).
  - Validate responsive design on desktop and mobile viewports.
- **Test Execution & CI/CD:**
  - Integrate Playwright tests into CI pipeline (GitHub Actions, Vercel, etc.).
  - Auto-run on PRs, merges, and scheduled intervals.
  - Collect artifacts: screenshots, videos, HTML reports.

## 2. User Journey Mapping

- **Critical Paths:**
  - Home → Analyze Resume → New Job Description → Select Resume → Analyze → Cover Letter → Generate
  - Home → Analyze Resume → Select Existing Analysis → Cover Letter → Generate
  - Home → Cover Letters → Select Analysis → Generate
- **Happy Path:**
  - Standard user flows with valid data and expected navigation.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Invalid file uploads, missing fields, network errors, direct deep links.
- **Error Scenarios:**
  - API failures, validation errors, session timeouts.
- **Cross-Browser:**
  - Run all journeys on all supported browsers.

## 3. Test Scenario Design

For each workflow:
- **User Story:**
  - E.g., "As a user, I want to analyze my resume against a job posting and generate a tailored cover letter."
- **Step-by-Step Actions:**
  - Detailed UI interactions (clicks, form fills, uploads, navigation).
- **Data Requirements:**
  - Test resumes, job descriptions, user accounts (fixtures).
- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - UI updates, success messages, correct analysis results, cover letter content.
- **Failure Scenarios:**
  - Error banners, retry options, validation messages.

## 4. Authentication & Authorization Testing

- **Registration/Login/Logout:**
  - Test all auth flows (if present).
- **Password Reset:**
  - Validate reset and error handling.
- **Role-Based Access:**
  - Ensure correct access for different user types (if applicable).
- **Session Management:**
  - Test session expiry, refresh, and security.

## 5. Core Functionality Testing

- **CRUD:**
  - Resume, job description, analysis, cover letter management.
- **Forms:**
  - Input validation, error handling, edge cases.
- **File Operations:**
  - Upload/download resumes, error handling for unsupported formats.
- **Search/Filter:**
  - History, resume selection, analysis lookup.
- **Navigation:**
  - Menu, breadcrumbs, direct links.

## 6. Payment & Transaction Testing

- *(Not applicable unless payment features are added)*

## 7. Mobile & Responsive Testing

- **Mobile Web:**
  - Touch, swipe, responsive layouts.
- **Cross-Device:**
  - Emulate phone, tablet, desktop.
- **Orientation:**
  - Portrait/landscape.
- **Performance:**
  - Load times, transitions.
- **Offline:**
  - PWA features if implemented.

## 8. API Integration Testing

- **Frontend-Backend:**
  - Validate API calls, error handling, and data sync.
- **Real-time:**
  - If present, test live updates.
- **External Services:**
  - Mock/fallback for AI providers.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Simulate network/API failures.

## 9. Performance & Load Testing

- **Page Load:**
  - Measure and assert load times.
- **User Actions:**
  - Response times for key flows.
- **Concurrent Users:**
  - Simulate multiple sessions (if needed).
- **Resource Usage:**
  - Monitor memory/CPU (optional).
- **Network:**
  - Throttle for slow/unstable connections.

## 10. Accessibility Testing

- **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - Tab order, focus management.
- **Screen Reader:**
  - ARIA, semantic markup.
- **Color Contrast:**
  - Validate with tools.
- **Focus:**
  - Indicators, skip links.

## 11. Test Implementation Approach

- **Page Object Model:**
  - Encapsulate UI selectors and actions for maintainability.
- **Test Data Management:**
  - Use fixtures for resumes, jobs, users.
- **Helpers/Utilities:**
  - Common actions (login, upload, navigation).
- **Assertions:**
  - Use Playwright expect for UI, API, and accessibility checks.

## 12. Test Environment Management

- **Setup/Cleanup:**
  - Reset state before/after tests.
- **Config:**
  - Use .env/test config for endpoints, credentials.
- **Database:**
  - Use test DB or mock storage.
- **Mock Services:**
  - For AI and external APIs.
- **Parallel Execution:**
  - Use Playwright's parallel test runner.

## 13. CI/CD Integration

- **Automated Execution:**
  - Run E2E on PRs, merges, nightly.
- **Reporting:**
  - HTML, JUnit, Slack notifications.
- **Artifacts:**
  - Screenshots, videos for failures.
- **Flaky Tests:**
  - Retries, quarantine, reporting.
- **Performance Regression:**
  - Track and alert on slowdowns.

## 14. Monitoring & Maintenance

- **Result Analysis:**
  - Review failures, triage issues.
- **Test Maintenance:**
  - Update tests as app evolves.
- **Performance Trends:**
  - Track over time.
- **Coverage:**
  - Identify gaps, improve coverage.
- **Reliability:**
  - Reduce flakes, improve stability.

## 15. Advanced Scenarios

- **Multi-Tab:**
  - Test cross-tab sync (if present).
- **Background Processing:**
  - Long-running ops.
- **Real-Time Notifications:**

**Next Steps:**
1. Set up Playwright in the project.
2. Scaffold the E2E test directory and initial test files.
3. Implement the first critical user journey test.
4. Expand coverage iteratively.

*Prompt me to proceed with Playwright setup and initial test scaffolding when ready.*
